Some options to visualize data from a 3D model

PhysiCell uses a combination of XML and (binary) MATLAB formatted files to store data 
for a 3D model. The rationale is described in the MultiCellDS project.

In this repository, we offer suggestions for visualizing PhysiCell 3D data. The focus will be on visualizing cells; however, some tools/scripts will also allow visualizing substrates and signals. Like PhysiCell, most of these tools are open source projects. 

We hope this repository will grow to include contributions from the PhysiCell community.
